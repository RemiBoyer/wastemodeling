# wastemodeling
For people and org who collect and treat the massive amount of garbage produce by our societies

## Concept and history
When you have to organize the waste collection and the waste treatment of a territory, you have to :
* estimate the waste production,
* find one or many efficient way of manage the processes to collect and treat
* submit your proposed solutions to all stakeholders (your boss, the local authority, inhabitants and the workforce)
* Choose the right way to do
* Implement this on the field with final success and intermediary ridiculous failure (leading to some cool war stories to brag with your children)
* Monitor the daily routine
* Evaluate and go back the first step (continious improvement)
