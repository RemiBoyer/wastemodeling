# Waste modeling tools
For people and org who collect and treat the massive amount of garbage produce by our societies

## Concept and history
When you have to organize the waste collection and the waste treatment of a territory, you have to :
* estimate the waste production,
* find one or many efficient way of manage the processes to collect and treat
* submit your proposed solutions to all stakeholders (your boss, the local authority, inhabitants and the workforce)
* Choose the right way to do
* Implement this on the field with final success and intermediary ridiculous failure (leading to some cool war stories to brag with your children)
* Monitor the daily routine
* Evaluate and go back the first step (continious improvement)

This work is derived from my first big job as civil servant and from an another worl in a now defunct SaaS startup.
As my work was along the way massively funded by public money, I feel today the need of giving back (on my free time, so I don't know if this repository will be useful someday).

## Needs
### You must gather and make computable an accurate knowledge of your territory
* Relevant data > fresh data > big data 
* Don't forget trends to tackle the freshness problem
* Accuracy is a sin I had (and I think I still have it)

### You must measure today waste
How do you know ?

### You must have some hypothesis for your future master plans
Do you want to :
* have a workforce ?
* collect each adress on a door to door route or do you want to ask inhabitants to brig their garbage in dedicated places ?

## Solution
### The waste production modeling
* for each material: Annual Production = ( (Number of Person x annual material reject per person) + the famous organization estimator + the famous "popping waste" estimator
* At the glance, linear models with magical ratio extracted from data describing the current state
* Complicated and complex refinement
