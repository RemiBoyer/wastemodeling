# Treatment
## Basic concepts
* factories
* Transport
* Second hand

## Waste network, Modeling a complicated system
* The big network of materials
* Many actors, many missing dataset
* Some flux leave the system, some flux come from nowhere

## Modeling a generic basic factory
* Input output
* Area and clients

## Each factory, each process is unique and needs its model
* Modeling x
* Modeling y
* Modeling z

## Treatment Model 1 : macromodel of factories and flux with small refinement for each process
* An executable view of the global system of the territory
* The model will simulate flux based on production and / or collect simulation
* Mainly a map and a dynamic system

## Treatment Model 2 : a digital twin to design a factory
* A static configurable view of the factory as real-estate, as space for work, as an **industrial process** ...
* A dynamic view of the **industrial process** involved
